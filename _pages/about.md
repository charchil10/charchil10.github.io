Industrial Engineering Grad Student with a Data Science concentration. 

I have been discovering insights from raw unorganised data and turning it into intuitive, interactive visualizations and Predictive analytics utilizing customised Machine learnings models, for almost 4 years now.

With my experience of data analysis and business intelligence I can help business to implement not only cutting-edge technology but also, industry best practices and grow distinguishably.

## Leisure 
When I was growing up, my mom had one piece of advice for me, and she said it every single morning. 'Get out of the house!' It's good advice. 
Love to go places and capture amazing moments to live them again!

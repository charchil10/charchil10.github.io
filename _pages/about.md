Industrial Engineering Grad Student with a Data Science concentration. 

I have been discovering insights from raw unorganised data and turning it into intuitive, interactive visualizations and Predictive analytics utilizing customised Machine learnings models, for almost 4 years now.

With my experience of data analysis and business intelligence I can help business to implement not only cutting-edge technology but also, industry best practices and grow distinguishably.

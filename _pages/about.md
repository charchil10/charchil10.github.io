I say this because I proven track record of my creative thinking and providing the business end to end solution from data gathering to informative visualization and predictive analytics enabling capacity planning.

I am also well versed using Agile scrum methodology, I always collaborated and kept the business ownerâ€™s interest and their end goals in mind.
